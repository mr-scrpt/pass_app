## üöÄ UI Redesign Plan

**New Concept**: The UI will be redesigned from a two-panel tree view into a single-view, search-oriented application.

**Key Features**:
1.  **Layout**: A search bar at the top, with a list of results below.
2.  **Search**: The list will filter in real-time as the user types in the search bar.
3.  **Details View**: Selecting a result will switch to a form-like view displaying the secret's details.
4.  **Form Fields**: Each detail (secret, metadata) will be in a read-only input field with "show/hide" and "copy to clipboard" buttons.

## ‚úÖ Done

15. **UI - Details Form Implemented**:

    *   Implemented read-only fields, show/hide visibility toggles, and copy-to-clipboard buttons.
    *   Verified by the user that the details view works correctly.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Step

*   **UI (`pass_client.py`) - UX Improvement: Focusless Navigation**:
    *   Implement an event filter to allow the search bar to control the list widget.
    *   When the user presses up/down arrows in the search bar, the selection in the results list will change.
    *   When the user presses `Enter` in the search bar, it will activate the currently selected item in the list.

## üöÄ Future UI Steps

1.  **Data & Search**: Load all secrets into a flat list and implement the real-time search functionality.
2.  **Views Switching**: Implement a `QStackedWidget` to switch between the search/list view and the details view.
3.  **Details Form**: Build the dynamic details form with non-editable fields, show/hide buttons, and copy buttons.
4.  **Integration**: Connect all backend commands (`show`, `create`, `edit`, `delete`) to the UI elements.
