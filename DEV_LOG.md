# Development Log: pass-cli-suite

## ✅ Done

1.  **Backend (`pass_backend.py`) - Fully Complete & Verified**:
    *   Implemented and verified all backend commands using the real `pass` utility.

2.  **UI - Prototyping & Feature Implementation**:
    *   Prototyped a TUI and then a GUI, leading to the final design.
    *   Implemented all core UI logic: search, list/detail views, keyboard navigation, and backend integration.
    *   Refactored main list view for dynamic item sizing and hover/selection effects.

3.  **UI (`pass_client.py`) - Edit Page Layout Fix**:
    *   **Analyzed Discrepancy**: Identified that `SecretEditWidget` used `QVBoxLayout` while `SecretDetailWidget` used the more appropriate `QFormLayout`.
    *   **Refactored `SecretEditWidget`**: Successfully replaced the `QVBoxLayout` with `QFormLayout`, creating visual consistency between the edit and detail pages.
    *   **Verified**: Adapted and confirmed that `add`, `delete`, and `save` functionalities work correctly with the new layout.

## ➡️ Next Step

*   **UI (`pass_client.py`) - Final Theming with `qt-material`**:
    1.  **Verify Theme**: The project already uses `qt-material` with a custom Catppuccin palette. Review the code to ensure the theme is applied consistently and correctly across all widgets, especially the newly refactored edit page.
    2.  **Connect Save Action**: Implement the `_save_secret` method in `MainWindow` to call the backend and persist changes.
    3.  **Refine & Polish**: Perform a final review of the UI for any minor style inconsistencies or usability improvements.
