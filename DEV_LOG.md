# Development Log: pass-cli-suite

## ⚠️ Major Pivot: TUI to Desktop GUI

**Decision**: The project requirements have changed from a Terminal UI (TUI) to a full-fledged Graphical User Interface (GUI) desktop application.

*   **Old Technology (Client)**: `prompt_toolkit` (Discarded).
*   **New Technology (Client)**: `PySide6` (Qt for Python).
*   **Backend**: The existing `pass_backend.py` is still valid and will be used as the backend for the new GUI client.

## ✅ Done

1.  **Project Setup**: Virtual environment and initial files created.
2.  **Backend (`pass_backend.py`)**: `list` and `show` commands implemented and tested with mock data.
3.  **Prototyping**: A TUI client was prototyped, which helped identify the need for a full GUI.

## ✅ Done

11. **Backend (`pass_backend.py`) - Fully Complete & Verified**:
    *   Fixed the `list` command to handle non-existent stores.
    *   Converted all commands (`list`, `show`, `create`, `edit`, `delete`) to use the real `pass` utility.
    *   Verified all testable commands via the terminal with a full create-show-delete cycle.

## ➡️ Next Step

*   **Resume UI (`pass_client.py`) - Implement `show`**:
    *   Connect the tree widget's selection event to the backend.
    *   When a user selects a secret, the client will call the real `pass_backend.py show`.
    *   The returned secret details will be displayed in the text area on the right.

2.  **Client - Layout & Data**:
    *   Create the main layout (e.g., a tree view on the left for secrets, a text area on the right for content).
    *   Call the `pass_backend.py list` command on startup and populate the tree view.

3.  **Client - Interactivity**:
    *   Implement logic to call `pass_backend.py show` when a secret is selected in the tree.
    *   Display the secret's content in the text area.

4.  **Backend & Client - Write Operations**:
    *   Implement `create`, `edit`, `delete` in the backend.
    *   Add corresponding UI elements (buttons, forms) and logic to the GUI client.
